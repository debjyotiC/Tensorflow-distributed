## Tensorflow Distrubited 
This repository contains code for distributed computing with Tensorflow 
 

## Dependencies required 
  1. `Tensorflow v2.0` : https://www.tensorflow.org/install


## Essentials:
TensorFlow supports distributed computing, this execution of the computational graph on a different processes, which can be a completely different server. In addition, this say you may have a powerful `GPU` in your home desktop and want to do some training on that using the data generated by you not so power `Raspberry Pi` that is running your current robotics project. 

TensorFlow works in the form of a server-client model, to be able to compute parts of the graph on a different server we need create a bunch of workers that will perform the heavy lifting on the `Raspberry Pi's` behalf. 

An example script to run on a single process, and then we will move to multiple processes.

```
import tensorflow as tf #import Tensorflow

a = tf.constant(3.0) #declare constants
b = tf.constant(2.0)

x = tf.add(a, b) #add
y = tf.multiply(a, b) #multiply
z = tf.add(x, y) #add

with tf.compat.v1.Session(config=tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True)) as sess:
    print(sess.run(z))

```
You then create a session on one of those workers, and it will compute the graph, possibly distributing parts of it to other clusters on the server.



## Adding NodeMCU support to Arduino IDE
Here's how to program the NodeMCU using the Arduino IDE.

`Step 1: Connect your NodeMCU to your computer`
You need a USB micro B cable to connect with the board. Once you are plugged in, a `blue LED` will start flashing. If your computer is not able to detect the NodeMCU board, you may need to download the driver from this `link` https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers.

`Step 2: Open Arduino IDE`
You need to have at least Arduino IDE version 1.6.4 to proceed with this.

Go to File > Preferences. In the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field, type (or copy-paste) http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json. Don't forget to click OK!

Then go to  Tools > Board > Board Manager. Type "esp8266" in the search field. The entry "esp8266 by ESP8266 Community" should appear. Click that entry and look for the install button on the lower right.

Once the download is complete, you can start coding!
